LD35 entry based on Javascript libGlov framework
============================

TODO:
X Score
* Level progressions
* Draw line of varying thickness/color through matches, or text of combo size
* More extreme animation when making match - go big and solid, then fade out, flash background
* Touch events
X Animate piece removals, droppings, 3 of a kinds
X Try different shifting methods:
  - no re-fill - kind of makes a solveable puzzle game?
  - swap all? - a little more clear what is going to happen, because there's no holes and no dropping, more strategic with mixed colors
  recycle squashed pieces to top?

Feedback:
  * clearer/bigger/better animation when making a match - make a good move look way better than a poor move
    - flash the background, etc
    - maybe shake the other tiles when you make a bad move that matches nothing
    - better/bigger effects as combo and chains increase

Thoughts:
  * "Slot machine" mechanic up top is totally okay (and probably addicting) - got rid of it anyway
